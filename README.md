# Gid Frontend

This repository hosts Gid's frontend code. It will provide web interfaces for managers and employees to:

- Interact with Gid beyond SMS (e.g., web dashboard).
- Review conversation histories, policy details, and management trait configurations.
- Access analytics, reports, and adjust Gid parameters as needed.

Structure:
- src/: UI components, pages, and front-end logic.
- public/: Static assets (images, CSS, etc.).
